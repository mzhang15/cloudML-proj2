# Neural Style Transfer



We deployed the neural style transfer model [by Gatys al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) onto IBM Cloud using Kubernetes service.

The images folders contains the sample inference images. You could customize it using your own photos. (Remember to crops photos into '512 by 512')

We will add instructions / tutorial on using IBM K8S in future.
