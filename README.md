# A little on Neural Style Transfer

Neural style transfer refers to algorithms that manipulate the original images and render a brand-new appearance with a different style. People have grown interested in this topic because it has wide applications in fields like transfer learning and domain adaptation. 

# Project Overview 

In this project, we plan to do a comparative study on two neural style transfer techniques:

1. [Neural Style Transfer]()
2. [cycleGAN]()

We utilizedcloud services for deep learning model training and deployed the trained model on IBM Cloud using Kubernetes services. Also, we evaluated the ML systems using the performance factors covered in our course.
